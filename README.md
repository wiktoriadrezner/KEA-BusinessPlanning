# Deep Dive: Business Planning
Deep Dive is one week of intensive work where the goal is to deep dive into specific subjects to improve your skills, knowledge and competences. The objectives are mainly learning new skills, gaining an undersanding of how you learn, documenting your learning resources and structuring your process of learning.

## üìö Deep Dive Subject
Business Planning and Project Management

Two weeks ago, I established my own sole proprietorship company in Sweden, and I am currently in the process of administration, branding and business planning. To be prepared and excel at my business, I need to deepen my knowledge of business, finance, and accounting. Therefore, I will devote my deep dive week to business plan development while developing my project management skills.

## üéØ Learning Goal
**SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Attractive, Realistic, Time-based

By the end of the week (29.09), I want to have a developed business plan for my company in both Swedish and English with 8 sections describing my business idea, positioning, competitors, customers, organisation, marketing, economy, and financing, that I can present to my clients. I will deepen the subject through own research by reading the available resources and articles, and I plan on completing at least one online course about business planning and/or project management.

## üñ•Ô∏è Digital Solution
As a Web Developer, I believe that it‚Äôs vague for me to devote a learning week for creating a website/portfolio, since I do create websites professionally. Therefore, as for the digital solution, I will deploy a simple sharable website in GitHub pages showcasing my way of developing a Business Plan for my company with three subpages/areas:
1.	**Introduction**: information about me, name, subject areas, line of study, professional specialisation, etc.,
2.	**Learnings/Findings**: what is the learning goal, how I scheduled my work and achieved the goal,
3.	**Materials**: references to the websites I visited, articles I read, courses I took part in, etc.
