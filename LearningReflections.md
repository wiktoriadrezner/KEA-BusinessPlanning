# Learning Reflections
### 1. What is my biggest strength?
High quality of work. I find it difficult to settle for less, and no matter what project I am working on/who is my client, I will ensure that my work will be of highest possible quality. I am a perfectionist at heart.

### 2. What is my biggest weakness?
I find it difficult to put as much attention into a project that is not part of my professional activities, such as putting schoolwork over my work that I get paid for and is part of my career.

### 3. What do I need to become better at?
Planning. I feel like I often lack a strong plan that will not change too much during a week. I do a lot of things very spontaneously, sometimes last-minute since I am generally a very busy person and I work a lot for my business.

### 4. What specific skill(s) is needed to do that?
Project management. I would need to learn how to delegate the tasks, plan my week and goals effectively so that I am happy with the results, but I also deliver.

### 5. In this week â€” what skills would I like to have achieved?
I would like to learn how to plan a business, from A to B. I am a very spontaneous and dynamic person, and I always take on projects as they go, and tend to move through them effortlessly, without following a strict structure. I would like to learn more about how to structure my projects, and in this case, business.
