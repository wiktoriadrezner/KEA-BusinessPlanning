                            Two weeks ago, I established my own sole proprietorship company in Sweden, and I am currently in the process of administration,
                            branding and business planning. To be prepared and excel at my business, I need to deepen my knowledge of business, finance, and
                            accounting. Therefore, I will devote my deep dive week to business plan development while developing my project management skills.
