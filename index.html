                            Hej! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Wiktoria Drezner, and I am a 22-year-old exchange student at KEA in Copenhagen. In August 2023, I came to Denmark
                            to embark on an exciting course, <b>Digital Product Development</b> to deepen my knowledge of project management, design thinking,
                            agile methodologies and start-ups.

                            On everyday basis, I study at <b>JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping University</b> in Sweden. I am currently in my last, 3rd year of Bachelor's in
                            Informatics. I study <b>Graphic Design and Web Development</b>. At my university, we utilise different methodologies and have a lot
                            of unique business cases to work with. So far, we had courses in graphic design, UX/UI design, visual communication, project
