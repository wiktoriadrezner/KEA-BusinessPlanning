# Learning Reflections â€” Final
### What did you learn about your learning this week?
What the Deep Dive proved to me is that I work more productively when I am outside of the school environment and devote my time solely to the activities I am interested in and can profit from. It is fairly easy to structure the work according to my needs and preferences. What might be challenging and I need to work on in the future is giving more attention to projects that are outside the scope of my expertise and that will not directly contribute to my profession. E.g., the purpose of the Deep Dive for me was to create a business plan, which I will use in my business. Hence, it was easy and pleasurable to work on that matter and deepen my knowledge of this topic. I would imagine that it would be more challenging to work on something that I do not find particularly interesting.

### What was difficult?
The biggest challenge during the Deep Dive was to document my learnings and keep track of resources and progress in a meaningful and concise way. At times, I find it scarce to elaborate on my processes when working on the project, as I believe that instead of writing about things, I might simply do things. Conclusively, writing and describing my progress was not the easiest task to complete.

### What was easy?
What was fairly easy was the actual work that I enjoyed throughout the entire time. For me, writing a business plan and researching the topics was pleasant, and I wanted to deepen my knowledge about it for a long time. Having a week designed specifically for that purpose, when I can research the subject in my own way and at my convenience, was a nice opportunity.
