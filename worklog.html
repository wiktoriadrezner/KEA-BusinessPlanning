                    Here, I explain what I did on every day of the Deep Dive week. I briefly mention what were my daily tasks and reflect on my performance and
                    acquired knowledge. I elaborate on what concepts I studied each day, in what way and how these helped with my learning.

                        <p>
                            On Monday, I focused solely on planning the Deep Dive and preparing myself for an intensive week. I spent approximately five ours
                            just to plan my workload and divide the tasks. I set up my GitHub repository that I was using to track my progress to have a clear
                            overview on what I need to do and what has to be done.

                        <h2>Tuesday, 26/09</h2>
                        <p>
                            On Tuesday, I began structuring the document for my Business Plan. I used my bank's resources to have a clear understanding on what
                            my BP should focus on, which sections I need to cover and how to explain my business.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            I came up with seven sections for my Business Plan: Summary (1), Business Idea (2), Target Market and Customers (3), Market Analysis
                            and Competiton (4), Business Description and Organisation (5), Sales and Marketing (6) and Economics and Finances (7).
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            In the afternoon, I began writing the first three sections of my Business Plan. I left out the first section, which is Summary (1),
                            and started with the Business Idea (2) where I explained in detail the structure of my business, what type of company Drezner
                            Digital is and what makes this venture unique. I then described briefly the market needs and how my company positions itself
                            accordingly to meet these needs. I finished the section with an explanation of how my business will be successful in regard to the
                            needs and how the company will progress over time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            I then moved to analysing the target market and customers. I explained in detail what are the markets that my company will target,
                            based on the four segmentation types: demographic, geographic, psychographic and behavioural. In this section, I had to do a lot of
                            external research and read about the topic, since I had only a very brief understanding of the concept of target markets. I then
                            explained what are the types of customers my company will primarily work with, and that I focus on both B2B and B2C solutions being
                            a Digital Agency.

                        <h2>Wednesday, 27/09</h2>
                        <p>
                            On Wednesday, I continued writing my Business Plan. My daily goal was to finish the two sections: Market Analysis and Competiton (4)
                            and Business Description and Organisation (5).
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            I quickly realised that Market Analysis and Competition will be a long section with lots of new information. I began writing by
                            creating a SWOT matrix that would help me identify my company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Working on a SWOT
                            analysis was a fun task, since I already completed a couple of them in the past as a part of my university assignments.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            When I completed a SWOT matrix, it was time to move to the market analysis. This point was very extensive, and I had to do a lot of
                            external research. In the section, I described how the digital market looks in Sweden and JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, what are the existing actors in
                            the landscape and how my business will position itself to be different, and offer a competitive advantage. I then did a research of
                            current trends within digital sector that might be beneficial if time comes to expanding my services. I concluded this section with
                            a broad description of my positioning.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            Having completed the fourth section of my Business Plan, I quickly moved to the next one, which was all about Business Description
                            and Organisation. This one was very easy to complete, as it felt natural to describe how I run my business. I explained the matters
                            such as what people are involved in the business acitivities and who is to be held liable. I then explained how I run my business
                            activities, how much I work weekly and where I perfom my services. I then explained if my company considers employing other workers
                            and collaboration. I concluded the section with a description of necessary equipment and maintenance.

                        <h2>Thursday, 28/09</h2>
                        <p>
                            Thursday was all about Sales and Marketing (6) and Economics and Finances (7) of my business. I began by alising what channels I
                            will use to market my business and sell my services, and came to conclusion that website, LinkedIn, Instagram and email marketing
                            are my primary channels of interest.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            I then explained how content marketing and advertising, as well as SEO can contribute to increasing sales in my company. As a SEO
                            practioner myself, it was fairly easy to expand on this concept.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            Another part of this chapter related to Messaging and Client Communication. I explained how I am going to communicate with my
                            clients, what will be the tone of my message and how to do those in the most efficient and direct way possible. I focused on
                            personalisation and timely responses for success.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            I concluded this chapter with a description of HVCO, a High-Value Content Offer that I will be happy to introduce in my company for
                            the purpose of generating leads and acquiring contact information of prospective clients.

                            The last chapter of my Business Plan was all about the finances and economics of the business. There, I described what is the
                            financial status of the business and what are the investment needs, as well as how does my own funding and cash flow impacts the
                            company's economics. I concluded the chapter with a description of future financial needs.

                        <p>
                            On Friday, I began finishing the Deep Dive and started developing my Digital Product, which is this website you're currently reading
                            the text from. I decided to go for the GitHub pages and code everything myself, since I am a Web Developer and knew that this will
                            be the most time-efficient solution and I will move quite fast with the progress.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            I needed to go through all the links, resources and notes I took throughout the week and make some meaningful connections between
                            those. I had to organise all of those, and I began coding. This part was very fun and exciting, and I enjoyed the process fully.
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-top">
                            In the afternoon, I consulted my sister to take a look at the Business Plan and share her thoughts. She advised me to expand more
                            the last section of my business plan which was all about the economics and finances. She gave me some constructive feedback that I
                            was happy to utilise.
