                    reflections from the beginning of the week and compare them with the reflections from the Friday's session at KEA.

                        <p>
                            By the end of the week (29/09), I want to have a developed business plan for my company in both Swedish and English with 8 sections
                            describing my business idea, positioning, competitors, customers, organisation, marketing, economy, and financing, that I can
                            present to my clients. I will deepen the subject through own research by reading the available resources and articles, and I plan on
                            completing at least one online course about business planning and/or project management.

                        <h2>Learning Reflections (Monday, 25/09)</h2>
                        <p>
                            Below, I gather my learning reflections from the beginning of the Deep Dive. I will later reflect on those on Friday to see whether
                            I have improved, what worked well and what could be improved if the next Deep Dive is to take place.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What is my biggest strength?</h3>
                        <p>
                            High quality of work. I find it difficult to settle for less, and no matter what project I am working on/who is my client, I will
                            ensure that my work will be of highest possible quality. I am a perfectionist at heart.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What is my biggest weakness?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I find it difficult to put as much attention into a project that is not part of my professional activities, such as putting
                            schoolwork over my work that I get paid for and is part of my career.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What do I need to become better at?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Planning. I feel like I often lack a strong plan that will not change too much during a week. I do a lot of things very
                            spontaneously, sometimes last-minute since I am generally a very busy person and I work a lot for my business.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What specific skill(s) is needed to do that?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Project management. I would need to learn how to delegate the tasks, plan my week and goals effectively so that I am happy with the
                            results, but I also deliver.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ In this week â€” what skills would I like to have achieved?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I would like to learn how to plan a business, from A to B. I am a very spontaneous and dynamic person, and I always take on projects
                            as they go, and tend to move through them effortlessly, without following a strict structure. I would like to learn more about how
                            to structure my projects, and in this case, business.

                        <p>
                            As of now, I have developed a business plan for my company in English with 7 sections my business idea, positioning, competitors,
                            customers, organisation, marketing, economy, and financing, that I can present to my clients. I have substanially deepened the
                            subject through own research by reading the available resources and articles, and I have completed one online LinkedIn course about
                            business planning.

                        <h2>Final Learning Reflections (Friday, 29/09)</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Deep Dive is officialy finished and the time came to reflect on my learnings. Below, I discuss what I did well and what could be
                            improved.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What did you learn about your learning this week?</h3>
                        <p>
                            What the Deep Dive proved to me is that I work more productively when I am outside of the school environment and devote my time
                            solely to the activities I am interested in and can profit from. It is fairly easy to structure the work according to my needs and
                            preferences. What might be challenging and I need to work on in the future is giving more attention to projects that are outside the
                            scope of my expertise and that will not directly contribute to my profession. E.g., the purpose of the Deep Dive for me was to
                            create a business plan, which I will use in my business. Hence, it was easy and pleasurable to work on that matter and deepen my
                            knowledge of this topic. I would imagine that it would be more challenging to work on something that I do not find particularly
                            interesting.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What was difficult?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The biggest challenge during the Deep Dive was to document my learnings and keep track of resources and progress in a meaningful and
                            concise way. At times, I find it scarce to elaborate on my processes when working on the project, as I believe that instead of
                            writing about things, I might simply do things. Conclusively, writing and describing my progress was not the easiest task to
                            complete.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What was easy?</h3>
                        <p>
                            What was fairly easy was the actual work that I enjoyed throughout the entire time. For me, writing a business plan and researching
                            the topics was pleasant, and I wanted to deepen my knowledge about it for a long time. Having a week designed specifically for that
                            purpose, when I can research the subject in my own way and at my convenience, was a nice opportunity.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ Did you achieve the learning goal?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Partially, yes, I achieved the learning goal. I have a completed business plan for my business. Though, I wrote it only in one
                            language. I have not completed a LinkedIn course, but that is yet to be done during the weekend.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What could you have done better?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I could improve my planning and make it more optimised to consider other business activities I work on during the week. When
                            planning a Deep Dive, I did not realistically assess my time availability and forgot about the time I needed to devote during the
                            week to my clients, who are my priority. At times, I worked only for the clients and pushed the Deep Dive to the side.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="margin-top">ðŸ’¡ What worked well that you will continue doing?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A key takeaway from this week was that as long as I am interested in the topic and have a personal interest in it, I will find it
                            pleasant to deepen my knowledge about it. I will keep on multitasking, which I do already, to meet both the school's requirements
                            and my clients' objectives.
