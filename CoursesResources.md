# Courses and Resources
Below, I collected a bunch of resources from LinkedIn and Google to examine and learn from during my Deep Dive. Apart from self-study, I strive to complete at least one of the following courses to accelerate my learnings and possibly gain a certificate. The courses revolve mainly around the topis of business planning, business development, strategic planning, and financing.
